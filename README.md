> If you ever thought, *"Why am I doing this by hand again?"*, you'll feel at home here.

## 💡 What Inspired This Repo?

**True story:** I was working on a side project late one night, and I realized I'd spent 15 minutes manually renaming 100+ files. Again. For the third time that week. I thought, *"There has to be a better way!"* 

So I wrote a quick Python script, and boom—10 seconds later, everything was done. That moment changed how I approached daily tasks. Why waste precious coding time on repetitive nonsense when you can automate it? This repo is my personal collection of "I'm never doing that manually again" scripts. Whether it's downloading videos, cleaning up messy text files, or checking the weather before heading out, these tools save me time every single day.

**The best part?** Time saved = time for learning, building cooler projects, or just relaxing with a cup of coffee. ☕
