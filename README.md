# Python Automation Suite
Every coder's lazy toolkit—simple scripts to automate boring stuff. If you ever thought, "Why am I doing this by hand again?", you'll feel at home here.

## Motivation
I hated spending 10 minutes doing something that could take 10 seconds. This repo is a small, honest collection of scripts for my day-to-day: renaming files, pulling data, reminders, and random other Python wizardry.

## Scripts to include:
- Bulk rename (photos, docs)
- Download YouTube playlists
- Quick text cleanup (remove duplicates, filter data)
- Weather fetcher for your city

Feel free to star/fork, or suggest silly/better ideas via issues!
